that is wrong syntax and will create an error

#what is the differences between low level & high level ?
'''
      - low level is a machine lang that is tough to understand the code written by.
      - high level is a programer friendly language , easy to understand.
'''
#What is the differences between = , ==
'''
 = is an assignment operator , but == is a comparsion operator if it equal or not .
'''

#What do we mean by using !=
''' that is meaning as a var is not equal the value .

#What is the operator precedence?
'''
the order of operations when coding 
++|--  ()  **  *|/  +|-

'''
# Create a variable x with value of 10
x = 10

# Increase x value by 15 using assignment operators
  x = x + 15 
  x += 15       

# Divide the x value by 5 using assignment operators
x = x / 5   
x /= 5

# Multiply the x value by 10 using assignment operator
 x = x * 10  
 x *= 10

# Get module of x on 3 using assignment operators
 x = x % 3  
 x %= 3

# Using python print the module of 11 to 4
 print( 11 % 4 )

# Print the exponent of 2,3
print( 2 ** 3)

# Divide 11 by 3 using python division
 11 / 3

## Can we divide 11 by 3 and get an integer number
"""" yes , we can
 $AS EX:  11 // 3 
# or 
x = 11 / 3
x = int (x)

# Check if 10 is bigger than 15 or not
  
# If 10 is not bigger than15 print x is smaller than 15
x = 10

## In which cases we will use all?
If we need all the conditions to be true 

# What is the differences between all , and

# What is the differences between any , or
 any ==> (When there are more than two conditions, at least one of them must be true.)
      or ==> (When there are two conditions, at least one of them must be true.)'''

# If we need all the conditions to be true we will use â€¦.
''' all '''

#What is the differences between if , elif
 if ==>  ( It can be used once in a conditional sentence.and it finds one condition that is True, it stops and doesn't evaluate the rest  )
elif ==>( It can be used more than once in a conditional sentence.when the conditions not pass and true.mutually exclusive conditions . )


# What is the differences between elif else
''' elif ==> (It can be used more than once in a conditional sentence.when the conditions not pass and true.mutually exclusive conditions . )
    else ==> (It can be used once in a conditional sentence. is used in the last case of all in the if statement.)

# Can we use more than one elif
''' ya, of course.'''

# Can we use more than one else
''' no , that will cause a problem .'''

#write s simple ternary operator

  print ("Hola Seniorta") if name == "Amira"  else print ("who you are")

#in elif , python will check all the conditions no matter what ?

'''no''' 

#in elif we use else for ... ?
